Welcome!

Boston DevOps is a group that is focused on bringing dev, ops, QA and anyone else interested in being part of a high-performing IT organization together to talk about how we improve our processes and tools to collaborate more easily.

We meet every month in a different venue in the Boston area.

This site is a work in progress. We'll be adding slides and videos from upcoming, as well
as past, presentations soon!
